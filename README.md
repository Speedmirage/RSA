# What Does this Program Do?

This program implements the RSA protocol on a python based project. This is your one stop shop for encrypting and partially decripting messages utilizing the RSA protocol. 

## Known Limitations

As of right now the program does not allow for the decryption of a custom message (meaning with custom N & D). This ability will for sure come is version 2.0

## How to run it?

1. Just run it [here](https://repl.it/@Speedmirage/RSA-Encryption-and-Decryption) and follow the on screen promts :)
2. Happy encrypting.
